# Hi, I'm Kavya Rajput 👋

Software Developer with a strong focus on building **scalable backend systems** and **performance-driven web applications**.  
I have hands-on experience designing **production-grade APIs**, implementing **secure authentication and authorization flows**, and working with **data-intensive applications**.

My core expertise lies in **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, where I focus on clean architecture, efficient data modeling, and reliability. On the frontend, I work with **React and Next.js** to build responsive, user-centric interfaces and seamlessly integrate them with backend systems.

I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end — from requirement analysis and system design to implementation, debugging, and deployment. I value **clean code, scalability, and long-term maintainability**, and I enjoy solving complex engineering problems in fast-paced environments.
